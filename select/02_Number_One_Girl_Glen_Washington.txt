My number one gal
You should know this by now
You are my number one gal
There is no other
Oh no not in this world
We'll live together
And severe we'll never
Like two piece in a pack
That's the way we will be
Now now
Baby just you wait and see
Some people may try
To keep us apart
They can't change the feelings
Deep within my heart
I know now for sure
I love you much more
Than you can imagine
Girl my love is for you
I need a love that I can feel
Yeah
You gave me a smile
And you went away
I pray to Jah
That one day you will come back and stay
I open my eyes
That's when I realise
All that I do
Is all about you
Baby
Well I love you really and true
Yeah
My number one girl
Oh

Baby baby

You should know this by now
There is no one for me but you
Honey I can't fight the feeling
Am in love with you really and true
I've been round the world
Seen many many girls
But none can't compare
Girl its all about you baby
Girl I love you really and true
Yeah
I know men will try
But I understand the reason why
If I should hurt you baby
Heaven and earth would cry
There is really no reason
For us to be apart
When all that I do is all about you baby
I love you really and true
You gave me a smile
And you went away baby
I pray to Jah
That one day you'd come back and stay
I open my eyes that's when I realise
That all that I do
Is all about you
Baby
Girl I love you really and true yeah
